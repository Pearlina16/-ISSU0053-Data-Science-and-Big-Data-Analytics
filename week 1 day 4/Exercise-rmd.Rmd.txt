## Introduction to R Notebook

R Notebooks provide a powerful and flexible way to interactively develop and share your R code. They allow you to combine code, output, and narrative text in a single document, making them ideal for data analysis, exploration, and reporting.

. Getting Started with R Notebooks

1- Creating an R Notebook

-   Open RStudio.

-   Go to `File > New File > R Notebook`.

2- Structure of an R Notebook

-   An R Notebook consists of text chunks and code chunks.

-   Text chunks are written in Markdown.

-   Code chunks are written in R and are enclosed by triple back ticks with `{r}` at the beginning.

-   You can run the code chunks individually and see the output immediately below the chunk

## Simple code block in R Notebook

```{r}
#This is a code chunk 
print("Hello")
```

-   Follow this link for more information on [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) .

## Using R Notebook and Tidyverse function for `hsb2` dataset

-   We will address some questions from the Day 3 document by utilizing tidyverse functions and documenting our code within an R Notebook.

```{r, warning=FALSE,error=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#Import Highschool data  and call it "highschool_raw"
```

### changing the levels enteries to labels using `mutate`

```{r}

#use Mutate command(change the levelss to factor variables)  to creat a dataframe named "highschool" from highschool_raw 


#remove female column, use `select` command

# check highschool data 
```

### renaming columns with `rename`

```{r}

#rename columns as follows:
#socioeconomic_group = ses,
#racial_group = race,
#school_type = schtyp,
                     

```

### Examples of tidyverse code

-   Answer the following : **Average scores for girls from public school**

```{r}

```

**Average scores for African-american students**

```{r}

```

**Data frame containing only student scores**

```{r}

```

### Pipes

Pipes `%>%` allow you to chain commands together, making your code more readable and efficient. The `tidyverse` package provides the pipe operator, and it is also included in the `dplyr` package.

## Pipe operators : `hsb2` data

-   Now that we are familiar with the hsb2 data, let's use the pipe operator to make our code more efficient and avoid creating multiple data subsets.

-   The following code demonstrates how to use the pipe operator to mutate, remove a column, and rename variables in the dataset, applying all these changes efficiently in a single pipeline:

-   In this code:

-   `mutate(new_column = some_transformation(existing_column))`: Adds a new column by transforming an existing one.

-   `select(-unwanted_column)`: Removes the specified column.

-   `rename(new_name1 = old_name1, new_name2 = old_name2)`: Renames specified columns.

-   Using the pipe operator (%\>%), all these operations are performed sequentially and the resulting dataset is assigned back to hsb2.

```{r}
highschool <- read_csv("hsb2.csv") %>% 
  mutate(race = factor(race, levels = c(1,2,3,4),
                             labels = c("hispanic", 
                                        "asian", 
                                        "african-american", 
                                        "white")),
         ses = factor(ses, levels = c(1,2,3),
                           labels = c("low", 
                                      "middle", 
                                      "high")),
         schtyp = factor(schtyp, levels = c(1,2),
                           labels = c("public", 
                                      "private")),
         gender = factor(female, levels = c(0,1),
                           labels = c("male", 
                                      "female"))) %>% 
  select(-female) %>% 
  rename( socioeconomic_group = ses, 
          racial_group = race, 
          school_type = schtyp)

highschool
```

-   write a code to provides a score_summary for females who are from public schools using the pipe operator to filter, summarize, and format the data:

## Your turn!

-   write a code to provides a score_summary for females who are from public schools using the pipe operator to filter, summarize, and format the data:

-   You may use the following commands:

-   Filtering [Data:\`filter(gender](Data:%60filter(gender){.uri} == "female", school_type == "public")\`: Selects rows where the gender column is "female" and the school_type column is "public".

-   `select(read:socst)`: Selects columns from read to socst. These columns typically represent different subjects such as reading, math, science, and social studies.

-   `summarise_all(mean)`: Computes the mean (average) for each selected column. This operation calculates the average score for each subject across all female students in public schools.

-   After executing this code, `score_summary` will contain a single row of data with the average scores for reading, math, science, and social studies among female students attending public high schools.
