This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

# Exercise

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
setwd("/Users/pp16/Desktop/NTU/UCL exchange/week 1 day 3")
children = read_csv("children_bodysize.csv")
```

-   Check data types for each column

```{r}
head(children)
```

-   Plot showing heights vs age

```{r}
plot(stature~age, data=children)
```

1.  How many entries are in the dataset?

```{r}
dim(children)
```

2.  What are the youngest and oldest ages of individuals in the dataset?

```{r}
min(children$age)
max(children$age)
```

3.  What is the tallest individual in the dataset, are they male or female?

```{r}
max(children$stature)
gender = children[children$stature==max(children$stature),]
gender$gender
```

4.  How many boys are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(children$gender=="M")
```

5.  How many girls over the age of 12?

```{r}

sum((children$gender=="F") & (children$age > 144))

```

6.  What is the mean height of a 5 year old boy and 5 year old girl?

```{r}
five = children[children$age == 60,]
boy = five[five$gender=="M",]
boymean= mean(boy$stature)
boymean
girl = five[five$gender=="F",]
girlmean = mean(girl$stature)
girlmean
```

7.  What is the mean height of a 15 year old boy and 15 year old girl?

```{r}
age = children[children$age == 180, ]
boys = age[age$gender=="M",]
boysmean = mean(boys$stature)
boysmean
girls = age[age$gender=="F",]
girlsmean=mean(girls$stature)
girlsmean
```

8.  Use a histogram to show the distribution of childrenâ€™s ages

```{r}
hist(children$age)
```

9.  What does the distribution of the heights of 9 year old males look like?

```{r}
male = children[children$gender=="M" & children$age == 108, ] 
male
hist(male$stature)
```

# Challenges

-   Create a column height_cm containing the height in cm (1cm = 10mm)

```{r}

children$height_cm = children$stature/ 10
head(children)
```

-   Create a column containing the age in years

```{r}
children$age_years = children$age/12
head(children)
```

-   Plot showing the average height of children by age

```{r}
rm(mean)
avg = aggregate(height_cm~age_years, data=children, FUN = mean)
plot(avg,children$age_years, pch = ".")
```
```{r}
bodysize_mod = group_by(children, age_years, gender)
height_by_age = summarise(bodysize_mod, height = mean(height_cm) )
plot(height~age_years, type="line", data=filter(height_by_age, gender=="M"))
lines(height~age_years, col="red", data=filter(height_by_age, gender== "F"))

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
