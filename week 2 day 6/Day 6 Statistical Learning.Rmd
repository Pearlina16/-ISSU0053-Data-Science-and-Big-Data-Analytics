# Hypothesis Testing

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
```

```{r}
adelie <- penguins %>%
filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
drop_na()
adelie
```

-   Question: Is there a difference in body mass for male and female Adelie penguins?

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species=="Adelie") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(count=n(), body_mass_g=mean(body_mass_g))
```

```{r}
t.test(body_mass_g~sex, data = adelie)
```

Letâ€™s calculate the mean, n, sd for female Adelie body weight:

```{r}
adelie_f <- filter(adelie, sex=="female")
mu <- mean( adelie_f$body_mass_g )
mu

n=nrow(adelie_f)
n

standard_error = sd(adelie_f$body_mass_g)/sqrt(n)
standard_error
  
```

Our 95% confidence interval on our mean measurement is

```{r}
qt(0.975,135.69)
mu-1.97*standard_error
mu+1.97*standard_error
```

## Hypothesis: mass of female Adelie penguins changed from 2007 to 2008

```{r}
table(adelie_f$year)
```

```{r}
adelie_f_2007_08 <- adelie_f %>% filter(year>=2007, year<=2008)
t.test(body_mass_g~year, adelie_f_2007_08)
```

# Exercise

## Example 1: Use a t-test to test the hypothesis that males and females have different body mass.

```{r}
chinstrap = filter(penguins, species == "Chinstrap")
t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex, chinstrap )
```

To test that females body mass is less than males we would use the one sided test.

```{r}
female = filter(chinstrap, sex=="female")
male = filter(chinstrap, sex=="male")
t.test(female$body_mass_g,male$body_mass_g, alternative = "less")
```

## Example 2

In this example we will look to see if there is evidence that the penguin bodymass differed for the chinstrap population sampled in 2007 vs 2008 the chinstrap population sampled in

```{r}
chinstrap_0708 = chinstrap %>%
  filter(year>=2007, year<=2008 )

t.test(body_mass_g~year, chinstrap_0708)
```

Anova test

```{r}
result = aov(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins)
summary(result)
TukeyHSD(result)
```
